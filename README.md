## 🚀 About Me

I'm a results-driven data analyst with a background in software development and a passion for solving real-world problems using data.  
Currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics in Berlin, I’ve built end-to-end projects that showcase my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data for decision-making.

I specialize in:

- 🧠 **SQL & Python** – Data wrangling, EDA, and advanced querying
- 📊 **Tableau & Power BI** – Building beautiful, interactive dashboards
- 🕸️ **Web Scraping** – Collecting real-world data when none is available
- 💼 **Business-Oriented Projects** – Focusing on insights that drive value
